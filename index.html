				<h2>About Company</h2>
				<p>Insource University provides the link between businesses searching for technology services and local college students who can meet those needs. College students are a wealth of untapped talent that businesses can now utilize for a variety of projects. </p>

				<p>Each project, ranging from a new logo to an updated website, provides the students with valuable work experience and some cash in their wallet. Businesses receive professional and personalized work, without breaking the bank! </p>
				<p>The best part is that Insource University pre-screens its students to provide  businesses with quality students and professional results. </p>

				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>Scott Salzman, a University of Florida student, was working on a team in charge of one of the largest student agencies on campus. The team found itself in need of a professional web developer for a major project. Due to the lack of suitable options, the team outsourced the project at a costly rate. <p>
				<p>The tedious process of impersonal phone calls and e-mails coupled with the high expense of the project sparked Scott's intuition. Why not tap into the professional talent all around him, the students? Scott then recruited a team of experienced student entrepreneurs, creating a source for finding these skilled students.</p>
				<p>Insource University now provides a marketplace with a win-win situation. Businesses can find local, cost-effective solutions to their problems and students can exercise their skills while making money and providing great results.</p>
