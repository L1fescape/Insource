			<div class=section>
				<p>Scott Salzman, a University of Florida student, was working on a team in charge of one of the largest student agencies on campus. The team found itself in need of a professional web developer for a major project. Due to the lack of suitable options, the team outsourced the project at a costly rate. </p>

				<p>The tedious process of impersonal phone calls and e-mails coupled with the high expense of the project sparked Scott's intuition. Why not tap into the professional talent all around him, the students? Scott then recruited a team of experienced student entrepreneurs, creating a source for finding these skilled students.</p>

				<p>Insource University now provides a marketplace with a win-win situation. Businesses can find local, cost-effective solutions to their problems and students can exercise their skills while making money and providing great results.</p>
